# Machine-Learning-Nanodegree
Projects completed as part of successfully completing the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree that demonstrate a range of Machine Learning skills.

The jupyter notebooks demonstrate the following skills:

## Supervised learning
finding_donors.ipynb covers a number of supervised learning techniques to find donors that meet certain criteria

# Unsupervised learning 
customer_segments.ipynb solves a marketing problem with a number of unsupervised learning techniques

# Reinforcement learning 
smartcab.ipynb use some introductory reinforcement learning techniques to train a cab to get from one side of a grid to another

# Deep Learning 
dog_app.ipynb covers a range of image recognition techniques, including developing a CNN.
